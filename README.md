# Binary-Heap-Structure
This hosts a binary heap data structure built using linked lists, which was programmed in Java using Eclipse. This activity was completed for a Data Structures course in the Spring of 2021.

The linked list was declared prior to my involvement, along with the main test method and a few debugging methods, and the rest of the code was developed by me.

The purpose of this heap was not for implementation in any particular project, but instead was used to illustrate a different method of implementing a binary heap using linked lists, which have a broad range of applications for storage and sorting algorithms.
