# Binary-Heap-Structure
This hosts a binary heap data structure built using linked lists

The linked list was declared prior to my involvement, along with the main test method but the rest of the code was developed by me.

The purpose of this heap was not for implementation in any particular project, but instead was used to illustrate a different method of implementing a binary heap using linked lists, as opposed to arrays.
